# Challenge Title
Binary Search

## Challenge Description
Perform a binary search with a given array and num, then find the index of the number if it is present in the array. If not return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency
Determine the start index and the last index. Then loop over while the end is not equal to or less than the start index. Determine the midpoint of the array and perform checks to determine if the num exist in the array. This is O(log n) time.
