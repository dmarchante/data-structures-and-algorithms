# Challenge Summary
Given an array and an input create a function the shifts the array at it's midpoint to insert the new input

## Challenge Description
Insert a given input at the input of a given array handling for even and odd length arrays. Then return the new array

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to get the midpoint index for a given array, create a new array whose length is one more than the original array. I looped through and if the index is the same as the midpoint set it equal to the new input.
