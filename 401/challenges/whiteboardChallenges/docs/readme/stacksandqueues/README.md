# Stacks amnd Queues List

## Challenge
Create stacks and queues that can insert new nodes via enqueue or push, remove nodes via pop or dequeue, and peak top/front values

## Approach & Efficiency
Create methods per docs then the Stacks and Queues in constructor. Then created the Node class with it's constructor. Fleshed out the pop, push, enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods. Finally wrote test to check the push, pop, enqueue, dequeue and peek methods

## API
### Stacks
pop method
  - to add new nodes
push method
  - to remove nodes and reset top value
peek method
  - view value of Top Node

### Queue
enqueue method
    - add to Queue
dequeue after method
    - remove form Queue
peek method
