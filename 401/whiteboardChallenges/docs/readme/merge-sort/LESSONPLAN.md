# Lecture Notes: Insertion Sort
This is an algorithm that takes in an unsorted array and sorts it.

By splitting an array with a merge sort we can reduce the time complexity of an insertion sort form O(n^2)  to O(n), and still being able to take in an array and transforming in place.

## Learning Objectives
To learn how to write a method that sorts an array with merge sort.
